``pypmc`` is a python package focusing on adaptive importance
sampling.  It can be used for integration and sampling from a
user-defined target density. A typical application is Bayesian
inference, where one wants to sample from the posterior to marginalize
over parameters and to compute the evidence. The key idea is to create
a good proposal density by adapting a mixture of Gaussian or student's
t components to the target density. The package is able to efficiently
integrate multimodal functions in up to about 30-40 dimensions at the
level of 1% accuracy or less. For many problems, this is achieved
without requiring any manual input from the user about details of the
function.

Useful tools that can be used stand-alone include:

* importance sampling (sampling & integration)
* adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (sampling)
* variational Bayes (clustering)
* population Monte Carlo (clustering)
